## Pre-requisites

- A Raspberry Pi (tested on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and compatible with other models)
- A camera module compatible with picamera2 (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3).
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Bullseye recommended)

## Bare metal installation (recommended)
To install Motionberry as a systemd service on your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

1\. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/j3ko/motionberry.git
```
2\. Run the installation script:
```bash
sudo bash motionberry/scripts/install.sh
```

Run the following to uninstall Motionberry:
```bash
sudo bash motionberry/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

## Docker installation
To install Motionberry using Docker on your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

1\. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

2\. Run the following command to deploy Motionberry: 
```bash
docker run --name motionberry \
  --privileged \
  -e PUID 1000 \
  -e PGID 1000 \
  -v <path to config.yml>:/motionberry/config \
  -v <path to capture directory>:/motionberry/captures \
  -v /run/udev:/run/udev:ro \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  j3ko/motionberry:latest
```

Explanation of Options:

- `--privileged`: Required for hardware access, such as the camera module.
- `-e PUID` / `-e PGID`: Set user and group IDs to match your system's user permissions.
- `-v <path>`: Map local directories to container paths:
  - `<path to config.yml>`: Path to your configuration file.
  - `<path to capture directory>`: Directory where captures will be stored.
- `-p 5000:5000`: Maps port 5000 on the host to the container.

Replace `<path to config.yml>` and `<path to capture directory>` with appropriate paths on your host machine.

## Configuration

For configuration options, refer to [config.default.yml](https://github.com/j3ko/motionberry/blob/main/config.default.yml).

## Notifications

Motionberry supports runtime notifications through flexible REST-compatible services like webhooks, ntfy, and Pushover.

| Type       | Description                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `http_post`| Basic POST request with raw body             |
| `form_post`| Sends as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` |
| `json_post`| Sends as `application/json`                  |

### Example: ntfy

Send a plain-text notification via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/):

```yaml
notification:
  motion_detected:
    - type: http_post
      url: "https://ntfy.sh/my-motionberry"
      headers:
        Title: "Motion Detected"
        Tags: "camera,warning"
      data: "Motion detected!"
````

### Example: Pushover

Send an alert to your mobile via [Pushover](https://pushover.net/):

```yaml
notification:
  motion_detected:
    - type: form_post
      url: "https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json"
      data:
        token: "${pushover_token}"
        user: "${pushover_user}"
        message: "ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Motion Detected! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨"
```

**Tip:** Environment variables like `${pushover_token}` can be used here.

### Dynamic Substitution

Notifications support dynamic placeholders. For example, to send the filename of a recorded clip:

```yaml
notification:
  motion_stopped:
    - type: http_post
      url: "https://ntfy.sh/my-motionberry"
      data: "Motion stopped. File saved: ${filename}"
```

### Supported Notification Actions

| Action Name           | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `application_started` | Triggered when the application successfully starts.            |
| `detection_enabled`   | Triggered when motion detection is enabled.                    |
| `detection_disabled`  | Triggered when motion detection is disabled.                   |
| `motion_started`      | Triggered when motion is detected and recording starts.        |
| `motion_stopped`      | Triggered when motion has stopped and recording ends.          |
| `motion_detected`     | Triggered when motion is detected (independent of recording).  |
| `motion_ended`        | Triggered when motion ends and a saved file becomes available. |

### Substitution Keys per Action

These keys can be used inside strings with the `${key}` syntax (e.g., `${filename}`).

| Action Name    | Substitution Key | Description                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `motion_ended` | `filename`       | The name of the saved video. |
